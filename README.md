# 🧠 Disease Prediction System using Machine Learning

This project is part of my internship on **Machine Learning using Python** at **Annasaheb Dange College of Engineering and Technology, Ashta**.  
It is a smart web application that predicts possible diseases based on user-input symptoms using trained machine learning models.

## 🔍 Overview

The Disease Prediction System is designed to act as an **AI-based preliminary diagnostic tool**, allowing users to enter symptoms and receive likely disease predictions. The goal is to enhance healthcare awareness and promote early medical attention.

## 🚀 Features

- Accepts multiple symptoms as input
- Predicts top possible diseases based on trained ML models
- Displays:
  - Disease **description**
- **Gradio-based web UI** for easy interaction
- Backend powered by **scikit-learn**

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** Gradio
- **Backend:** Python
- **ML Models:** Random Forest
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, Gradio
